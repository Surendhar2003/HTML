            <h1>  Are pre-installed phone apps a national security threat?</h1> 
            <article> 
                The Centre plans to force smartphone makers to allow removal of pre-installed apps, Reuters has reported.
                These apps could be a threat to national security and make users vulnerable to data abuse by foreign players including China.
                The government has proposed new security rules to mandate, among other things, screening of major operating system updates.

    <h1>   India remains severely polluted but…</h1> 
    <article>  
        <pre>
        India is the world’s eighth most polluted country, according to Swiss firm IQAir's World Air Quality Report 2022 released on Tuesday.
        Chad, Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Kuwait, India, Egypt and Tajikistan have emerged as the top 10 most-polluted countries.
<h4>The Good</h4>
India had ranked fifth in IQAir’s 2021 list of world’s most polluted countries. This year, it has dropped to the eighth rank.
Some may call it a big leap towards being ‘less-polluted’. 
Some can call it an indication of other nations scoring exponentially high on the pollution meters to overtake India in a never-ending fall.
<h4>The Bad</h4>
Out of the 50 most polluted cities in the list, 39 are in India.
After the two top most-polluted cities, Lahore in Pakistan and Hotan in China, Rajasthan's Bhiwadi is in third place and Delhi ranked fourth.
 Delhi's PM2.5 level is almost 20 times the safe limit, the report stated.
